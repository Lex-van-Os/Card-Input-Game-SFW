"# Input-Card-Game-SFW" 

The Input Card Game SFW is the SFW version of my own selfmade clone of Cards Against Humanity. This is my first big Python project.

My inspiration to create this project came when I was playing a game of Cards Against Humanity with my friends. I told them that I'd create my own version of Cards Against Humanity, and so I did, although this is a console version of the game.

The game is started by launching gameboard. This will take you through some set-up functions, after which the game will start. After the game has been completed, the user will be asked if he wants to play another game

The game starts by printing out a randomly choosen sentence which the players will have to fill with their randomly choosen hand of cards. 

During the game, a random player will be chosen as the czar. If you are the czar, you don't get to play a white card for that round, but you get to choose which played combination you like the best. Once having entered the player name, that player gets a point. After the round is over, the next player will be the czar

The game plays based on the amount of points the game plays to. The player with the most amount of points wins
